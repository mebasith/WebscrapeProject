## Getting started

1. Unzip files onto your local system.
2. Run `npm install` from your terminal.
3. To run the application run `npm start` or if you want to run it in 'development' mode run `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
4. Navigate to [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to view the UI and begin using the application. App functionality is demonstrated in the below gif.
